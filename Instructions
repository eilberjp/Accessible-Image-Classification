Casual Users:
-Ensure that you have all of the appropriate Python libraries installed (check the import statements at the top of the script)
-Modify any parameters within 'params' near the bottom of the script. Avoid modifying anything else unless you know what you're doing.
-Enter your image directories in 'directories'. Ensure that the directories you input are within the same working directory as the script itself
-Run the script

Expert Users:
In addition to modifying any parameters within train_params, directories, and misc_params, modify any of the definitions to your liking.
