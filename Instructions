Casual Users:
-Ensure that you have all of the appropriate Python libraries installed (check the import statements at the top of the script)
-Modify parameters (near the bottom of the script). Avoid modifying anything else unless you know what you're doing.
-Enter your image directories (near the bottom, too). Ensure that the directories you input are within the same working directory as the script itself
-Run the script

Expert Users:
In addition to modifying any parameters, modify any of the definitions to your liking. Good luck!
